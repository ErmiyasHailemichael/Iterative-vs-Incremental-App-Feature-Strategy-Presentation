# Iterative-vs-Incremental-App-Feature-Strategy-Presentation

My Idea: I am working on a new feature for a ride-sharing application, similar to what Uber offer. This feature would enhance the rider's experience by allowing them to create a music or podcast playlist. When a rider books a ride, their selected playlist would be visible to the driver, enabling the driver to play the customer's preferred music or podcasts during the ride. 

## 1. Project Objectives

**Primary Objective:** To enhance the ride experience by allowing passengers to create and share their music/podcast preferences with drivers, enabling a personalized audio environment during their trip.

**Secondary Objectives:**

* Increase rider satisfaction and loyalty.
* Provide drivers with a way to enhance their service quality.
* Differentiate from competitors through personalization.
* Potentially create partnership opportunities with music/podcast streaming services.

## 2. Approach Analysis

### Iterative Approach

In an iterative approach, you'd develop the entire feature but refine it through successive versions:

**Iteration 1:**

* Basic playlist creation functionality integrated with popular streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music).
* Simple interface for riders to select/save playlist preferences in their profile.
* Basic notification to drivers about rider music preferences.
* Manual implementation by drivers (they'd need to open their own streaming app).

**Iteration 2:**

* Refined UI based on user feedback.
* Added ability to set different playlists for different trip types (commute, airport, night out).
* Improved driver notification with direct links to playlists.
* Basic integration with vehicle audio systems for select car models.

**Iteration 3:**

* Added podcast support.
* Implemented volume/genre preferences.
* Added "music mood" feature based on trip context.
* Expanded vehicle audio system integration.
* Added rating system for musical experience.

### Incremental Approach

In an incremental approach, you'd build and deliver distinct functional components sequentially:

**Increment 1: Music Profile Feature**

* Complete rider profile section for saving music preferences.
* Ability to link streaming service accounts.
* Playlist saving functionality.
* Profile modification capabilities.

**Increment 2: Driver Notification System**

* Complete system for notifying drivers of passenger music preferences.
* Driver interface showing playlist details.
* Driver controls for accepting/declining music requests.
* Help documentation for drivers.

**Increment 3: Integration Module**

* Full integration with vehicle audio systems.
* Automatic playback capabilities.
* Volume control features.
* Expanded streaming service partnerships.
